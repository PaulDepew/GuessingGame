                            My  entire life I have been a man put beyond his depth. Ever since I was  ten years old the world has been throwing me into things that I had no  real business being a part of. All I had to do... was do it. Along the  way you find the amazing things that makes life worth living. The  people, the places, the names and the faces... 
                            <br />
                            I attened the Evergreen State College in Olympia where I majored in Community Development and Dramaturgy. While there I was active in the Musical Theatre and Opera programs. This continued through my life long love of music and arts. As a guitarist and multimedia artist, its all about keeping busy and building communities. 
                            <br />
                            Professionally, I have worked developing public arts organizations, public and private arts events and most recently been part of a cannabis tech start-up in the retail enterprise solutions sector. This start-up really inspired me to start looking at coding seriously. I would love to be able to utilize coding to provide tech opportunities to disadvantaged and disabled persons.
